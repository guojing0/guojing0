I am currently working on [Nyxt](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt), which is a web browser written in Common Lisp, how cool is that?

You can support me via buying me [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/guojing0).

Other than writing codes, I also write proofs. My website is [guoj.org](https://guoj.org/).
