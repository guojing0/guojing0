Personal website: [*guoj.org*](https://guoj.org/)

I am a fan and a contributor of [**SageMath**](https://github.com/sagemath/sage), especially its algebraic geometry and graph theory libraries.

I also enjoyed writing Common Lisp for [**Nyxt**](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt).

You can support me by buying me [*coffee*](https://ko-fi.com/guojing0), or just on [*Paypal*](https://paypal.me/guojing0).
